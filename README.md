Emotions Analysis in Virtual Reality Environmrnt: An EEG Dataset and Evaluation

The Virtual Reality EEG (VREEG) Emotions Dataset was recorded at the Internet of Things Lab in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Patna, Bihar, India. The VREEG dataset was recorded in a virtual environment using an HP Virtual Reality headset to elicit strong emotions. The dataset was captured using a 32-channel EEG Emotiv Epoc Flex Cap and includes four distinct classes: happy, fear, neutral, and sad. The EEG signals were recorded following specific set protocols when the participants
agreed on these conditions; then, after these signals were recorded and for agreement purposes, a written consent form was taken from each participant.

The experimental setup included 70 participants, comprising 50 males and 20 females, with an average age of 26. The participants' ages ranged from a minimum of 18 to a maximum of 36 years.

The experiment took place for four emotions, happy, fear, neutral, and sad, based on the EEG signals for each subject; the EEG signal was
recorded in four different situations while watching the videos according to the stimuli, around 30 − 40 minutes are required to collect the data for one subject, including relaxation time after each recording. 

The total time needed in data acquisition considered setup time as tsetup, time taken during relaxation tR, for happy emotion tH, fear emotion tF , neutral emotion tN , sad emotion tS, and total time ttotal calculated as for one subject. 

ttotal = tsetup + tH + tR + tF + tR + tN + tR + tS
ttotal = tsetup + 3 × tR + tH + tF + tN + tS

Note: The current repository contains only a subset of files for each class in VREEG Dataset folder. The complete dataset is available upon request. Researchers interested in obtaining the dataset can contact us via email and should include the purpose of their dataset usage in the email. Upon receiving the request, we will grant access to the complete dataset.
